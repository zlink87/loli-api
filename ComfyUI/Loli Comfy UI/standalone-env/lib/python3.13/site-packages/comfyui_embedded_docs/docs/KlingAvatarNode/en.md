The Kling Avatar 2.0 node generates broadcast-style digital human videos. It uses a single reference photo and an audio file to create a talking avatar video. An optional text prompt can be used to define the avatar's actions, emotions, and camera movements.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | - | Avatar reference image. Width and height must be at least 300px. Aspect ratio must be between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1. |
| `sound_file` | AUDIO | Yes | - | Audio input. Must be between 2 and 300 seconds in duration. |
| `mode` | COMBO | Yes | `"std"`<br>`"pro"` | The generation mode to use. |

**Note:** The `image` and `sound_file` inputs have specific validation requirements. The image must be at least 300x300 pixels with an aspect ratio between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1. The audio file must be between 2 and 300 seconds long.
